,Immortal Technique,"Our hearts were torn apart just like y'all was Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust Everytime we called your office you ignored us Now you holding hearings on us all inside of Congress Microscopes on us, ask if we're jihadists My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers I think Patrick said it best  Give me liberty or death I shall never accept anything less You claim innocence, you play victimless But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end Of pacifying your citizenry with excess We believe in freedom, justice, security But they're only pure when they're applied universally So certainly if I rage against the machine My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry Urgently putting fear inside your heart Make you burn Qu'rans and tell me not to build a mosque Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made jihad We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few What happens when that few includes you? Civil war They say the odds against me are crooked and impossible Like I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle I was left to die by the doctors in the Children's Hospital But I never lose hope, success is psychological The world is volatile and the street is my education Shapin' the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion So I'm focused on my economic situation I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh A lot of niggas drop science, but they don't know the math Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path It's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash But never raise the gun and cry out, ""Freedom at last!"" The cold war is over, but the world is still gettin' colder Atlas walkin' through the projects, with the hood on my shoulders I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers But then a general will decide when their life would be over So I work hard until my personality's split Like the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin' through Genesis Ignorance is venomous, and it murders the soul Spreadin' like a virus, runnin' rampant, out of control ",FALSE,Nonmisogynistic
